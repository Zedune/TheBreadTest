                            <p>Visual learners work best when activities are engaged by images, charts, or visual material. They think through images rather than words when working through activities, often finding it easier to see the bigger picture. Visual learners are encouraged to create mind maps, drawings, or diagrams of information that needs to be memorised and to construct a visual representation of information being taught in classrooms. Visual learners may struggle to memorise smaller details or read paragraphs for a long duration.</p>

                            <p>This learning style is hands-on, practical, and movement-oriented. These learners prefer physical, direct interaction with learning materials. They perform at their best when given the opportunity to &#39;do&#39; rather than listen or watch. In the classroom, these learners thrive through hands-on activities such as experiments, building models, or mapping out concepts using hand-drawn diagrams. They are likely to struggle in classroom settings which involve lectures and videos that go on for a long period of time. In these cases, they may become inattentive in class or even disruptive.</p>

                            <p>Social and collaborative, interpersonal learners enjoy working in groups and discussing ideas as a class. They excel when given opportunities to engage in debates, teamwork, and collaborative problem-solving activities. They often take leadership roles in group settings and enjoy helping others understand concepts. Given their highly social learning style, these learners are easily distracted and can become sidetracked easily when working with peers. Additionally, they may struggle in individual tasks or exam settings.</p>

                            <p>These learners enjoy learning through both written and spoken words. Naturally drawn to language, they excel in activities like reading, writing essays, storytelling, and engaging in debates. Learning techniques such as mnemonics, creating videos, and reciting palm cards work really well with these learners. Verbal-Linguistic learners dislike silence, and mathematics is probably their natural enemy.</p>

                            <p>Challah archetypes are often the centre of their friend groups, always willing to lend an ear, offer support, or share a laugh. In class, these students are not afraid to share their feelings or thoughts, especially in discussions that involve personal reflections or topics that resonate with them emotionally. They take pride in creating work that is not only correct but also beautiful and meaningful, they may decorate their assignments with extra flair or put thought into making presentations visually appealing. Their desire to connect can drive them to participate actively, especially in group activities that involve personal sharing but can sometimes become distracted by friends and conversations over time. Their deep investment in relationships can lead to them blurring boundaries, such as oversharing or taking others&#39; emotional burdens.</p>

While they are not necessarily rebellious in a serious way, Sourdough questions rules and norms through humour. Their playful nature can encourage other students to engage more, especially in otherwise dull or intimidating activities. However, Sourdough can be quite disruptive in class with their antics, making it difficult for others to focus or for the teacher to maintain control. They may struggle to take things seriously, especially when faced with assignments or topics that require a more genuine approach.</p>

This is because of their approachability due to their non-judgmental nature and how they include everyone. White Bread archetypes usually prefer more concrete concepts and examples over abstract ones, which is great for practicality but usually lacks creativity. Teachers and peers can count on them to be dependable and to handle responsibilities effectively but would try to avoid situations where they can be given responsibility. This is because their preference for fitting in leads them to shy away from leadership positions or standing out. To keep the peace and avoid conflict, they might steer clear of controversial topics, which can limit their engagement in important debates or situations.</p>

                            <p>Rye Bread archetypes are driven by their desire for personal achievement and deep sense of responsibility. They tackle problems head-on and take the lead in group settings. Rye Bread students have a strong internal drive and sense of purpose, making them natural leaders. However, this can make them focus on personal achievements rather than collaboration, and they become frustrated when they do not meet their own standards. Teachers and peers can rely on Rye Bread to take initiative without avoiding uncomfortable situations. However, they are competitive and can sometimes overshadow others even though their contributions are equally valuable. Their focus on all-round excellence is good, but this can lead to burnout if they feel like they are failing to meet their high standards.</p>

                            <p>Baguette archetypes have a strong sense of responsibility when placed in groups or contributing to the lesson. They value control and order in classroom environments and try to prevent chaos even if that is not their obligation. This can cause them to leave a lasting impact on their classmates, teachers and school (some may say they “peaked” in high school). Baguette exudes confidence in their ability to make decisions even when under pressure. However, their need for control can lead to the inability to delegate tasks to others. This can lead to stubbornness, resistance to change and struggle to listen to others&#39; ideas especially when in a group setting. The archetype opposite to the Baguette is the Bagel, who challenges rules and can be a disruption to other students’ learning.</p>

They may also struggle to take criticism because they perceive it personally or become overwhelmed by their emotions. The Baguette archetype would be the opposite of the Croissant. This is because Baguette tends to value control over creativity and strive to prevent chaos, unlike Croissant who embraces chaos.</p>
